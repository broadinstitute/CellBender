We aspire to make CellBender an easy-to-use, robust, and accurate software package for the bioinformatics community.
While we test and improve CellBender together with our research collaborators, your feedback is
invaluable to us and allow us to steer CellBender in the direction that you find most useful in your research. If you
have an interesting idea or suggestion, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

If you encounter a bug, please file a detailed github `issue <https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/issues>`_
and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
