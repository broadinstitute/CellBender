.. _a1:

* What are the "best practices" for running the tool?

  * See the :ref:`recommended best practices <best-practices>`

.. _a2:

* What are the "best practices" for incorporating CellBender into my analysis pipeline?

  * See the :ref:`proposed pipeline <proposed-pipeline>`

.. _a22:

* How do I load and use the output?

  * The data can easily be loaded as an ``AnnData`` object in python, to be used in
    ``scanpy``, or it can also be loaded by Seurat, see the
    :ref:`example here <downstream-example>`
  * We recommend loading the input and output data (together) using the function
    ``cellbender.remove_background.downstream.load_anndata_from_input_and_output()``
    from the CellBender package, since that will create an ``AnnData`` with
    separate layers for the raw data and the CellBender output data.  This is
    quite handy for downstream work.  There are several simple data-loading
    functions in ``cellbender.remove_background.downstream`` that might be
    useful.

  .. code-block:: python

     from cellbender.remove_background.downstream import load_anndata_from_input_and_output

     adata = load_anndata_from_input_and_output(input_file='tiny_raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5ad',
                                                output_file='tiny_output.h5')
     adata

  .. code-block:: console

     AnnData object with n_obs × n_vars = 1000 × 100
         obs: 'background_fraction', 'cell_probability', 'cell_size', 'droplet_efficiency', 'n_cellranger', 'n_cellbender'
         var: 'ambient_expression', 'features_analyzed_inds', 'feature_type', 'genome', 'gene_id', 'n_cellranger', 'n_cellbender'
         uns: 'cell_size_lognormal_std', 'empty_droplet_size_lognormal_loc', 'empty_droplet_size_lognormal_scale', 'posterior_regularization_lambda', 'swapping_fraction_dist_params', 'target_false_positive_rate', 'fraction_data_used_for_testing', 'test_elbo', 'test_epoch', 'train_elbo', 'train_epoch'
         obsm: 'cellbender_embedding'
         layers: 'cellranger', 'cellbender'

.. _a23:

* What are the details of the output h5 file format?

  * :ref:`See here <h5-file-format>`

.. _a3:

* Do I really need a GPU to run this?

  * It's not absolutely necessary, but the code takes a long time to run  on a full
    dataset on a CPU.
  * While running on a GPU might seem like an insurmountable obstacle for those without
    a GPU handy, consider trying out our
    `workflow on Terra <https://portal.firecloud.org/#methods/cellbender/remove-background/>`_,
    which runs on a GPU on Google Cloud at the click of a button.
  * Others have successfully run on Google Colab notebooks for free.  Since CellBender
    produces checkpoint files during training (``ckpt.tar.gz``), you can even pick up
    where you left off if you get preempted. You just need to put the ``ckpt.tar.gz``
    file in the directory where the CellBender command is being invoked (or
    specify the file using the argument ``--checkpoint``), and CellBender will
    automatically pick up where it left off when the same command is re-run.
  * If you really want to use a CPU only, then consider things that will speed up the
    run, like using fewer ``--total-droplets-included``, and increasing the threshold
    ``--projected-ambient-count-threshold`` so that fewer features are analyzed,
    and maybe decreasing ``--empty-drop-training-fraction``, so that each minibatch
    has fewer empty droplets.

.. _a4:

* How do I determine the right ``--fpr``?

  * See the :ref:`recommended best practices <best-practices>`

.. _a5:

* How do I determine the right ``--expected-cells``?

  * See the :ref:`recommended best practices <best-practices>`

.. _a6:

* How do I determine the right ``--total-droplets-included``?

  * See the :ref:`recommended best practices <best-practices>`

.. _a7:

* Does CellBender work with CITE-seq data?  Or other non-``Gene Expression`` features?

  * Absolutely, `as shown here <https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender/issues/114>`_
    and `in our paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/791699v2>`_.
    The results for ``Antibody Capture`` data look even better than
    for gene expression, due to the higher ambient background for that modality.
  * ATAC data is a bit more tricky. CellBender will run, though it takes a long
    time with 200k+ Peak features. You can use the argument
    ``--projected-ambient-count-threshold 2`` to tell CellBender to ignore all
    features which are not estimated to have at least two noise counts in cells.
    This can greatly speed things up. Feel free to experiment with that value.
    Anecdotally it seems that ATAC data is less noisy than gene expression data
    to begin with, so some users opt to have CellBender ignore the ATAC features
    using the input argument ``--exclude-feature-types Peaks``. There is nothing
    wrong with doing this.

.. _a8:

* Could I run CellBender using only ``Gene Expression`` features and ignore other features?

  * If you want to, you can (though it works great with ``Antibody Capture`` data):
    just use the ``--exclude-feature-types`` input parameter.

.. _a24:

* Could I run CellBender using only ``Antibody Capture`` features and not ``Gene Expression``?

  * No, it is not a good idea to exclude ``Gene Expression`` features for the following
    reason: the ``Gene Expression`` features form the basis of a good prior on "cell type",
    which the method heavily relies on to denoise. Other features, without ``Gene Expression``,
    are probably too sparse to cluster similar cells together and form a good prior for
    "which cells are similar to which others".

.. _a9:

* Where can I find the ambient RNA profile inferred by CellBender?

  * This is present in the output h5 file as the field called
    ``/global_latents/ambient_expression`` (:ref:`see here <h5-file-format>`).
    If you use the dataloader from ``cellbender.remove_background.downstream``
    (:ref:`see here <a22>`), then the ambient expression profile will be loaded
    into the AnnData object as ``adata.var['ambient_expression']``
  * (Though it is referred to here as "ambient RNA", all features are included,
    not just Gene Expression.)

.. _a10:

* The code completed, but how do I know if it "worked"?  / How do I know when I
  need to re-run with different parameters?

  * The vast majority of runs using a nice dataset will work just fine. If your
    dataset might not be so "nice", then we recommend taking a look at the output
    ``_report.html``, which will have a few diagnostics and will issue warnings
    and recommendations as appropirate.
  * In general, if the learning curve (ELBO versus epoch) has huge spikes, or if
    if does not converge near the end but rather dips back down, then you may
    need to consider re-running with a lower ``--learning-rate``. The solution
    is typically to reduce the ``--learning-rate`` by a factor of two.
  * In certain cases, it may be obvious that CellBender has failed to call cells
    accurately. In these cases, it may be necessary to do a bit of experimentation
    with ``--expected-cells`` and ``--total-droplets-included`` to try to guide
    CellBender toward a more reasonable solution.  It has been our observation
    that such cases are relatively rare. Try looking at the UMI curve and picking
    a value for ``--expected-cells`` where you know that all the droplets
    preceding that number are surely cells.

.. _a11:

* It seems like CellBender called too many cells

  * Did it?  ``remove-background`` equates "cell probability" with "the probability that
    a given droplet is not empty."  These non-empty droplets might not all contain healthy
    cells with high counts.  Nevertheless, the posterior probability that they are not empty
    is greater than 0.5.  The recommended procedure
    would be to filter cells based on other criteria downstream.  Certainly filter for percent
    mitochondrial reads.  Potentially filter for number of genes expressed as well, if
    this does not lead to complete loss of a low-expressing cell type.
  * Experiment with increasing ``--total-droplets-included``.
  * Experiment with increasing or decreasing ``--empty-drop-training-fraction``.
  * As a last resort, try decreasing ``--expected-cells`` by quite a bit.

.. _a12:

* It seems like CellBender called too few cells

  * If CellBender seems to have missed cells, or if you get a "No cells found!"
    error, then try increasing ``--expected-cells``, and also ensure that your value
    for ``--total-droplets-included`` is large enough that all droplets after
    this value on the UMI curve are "surely empty".

.. _a25:

* The PCA plot of latent gene expression shows no clusters or structure

  * Has training converged?  Training should proceed for at least 150 epochs.  Check to
    make sure that the ELBO has nearly reached a plateau, indicating that training is
    complete.  Try increasing ``--epochs`` to 300 and see if the plot changes.
  * This is not necessarily a bad thing, although it indicates that cells in the experiment
    had a continuum of expression, or that there was only one cell type.  If this is
    known to be false, some sort of QC failure with the experiment would be suspected.
    Perform a downstream clustering analysis with and without ``cellbender remove-background``
    and compare the two.

.. _a13:

* The learning curve looks weird. / What is the learning curve supposed to
  look like?

  * The "learning curve", a.k.a. the plot of ELBO (evidence lower bound) verus
    training epoch, is a record of the progress of inferring all the latent
    variables in the CellBender model, based on data.  This learning happens via
    gradient descent.  Typically, the ELBO changes gradually, increasing and
    approaching some rather stable value by the end of training.  Ideally, the
    ELBO increases monotonically.

  * If the learning curve either starts decreasing, or has a large downward bump
    or a downward spike or spikes, then something may have gone a bit "off the
    rails" during training. We would be concerned that, for example, the inference
    procedure got thrown off into some local minimum that is sub-optimal. If you
    see a learning curve that looks strange, then try to re-run with half the
    ``--learning-rate`` and see if it results in a more "canonical" learning curve.
    If it does, use that output.

  * Examples: 2 fine learning curves (panels on right are zoomed-in y-axis)

  * Examples: 2 bad learning curves

       :width: 700 px

.. _a14:

* What is the ``metrics.csv`` output for, and how do I interpret the metrics?

  * This is a bit of a niche output, and most people can ignore it if they want
    to. The idea here is to enable automated analysis pipelines to make decisions
    about whether to re-run CellBender with different parameters. Several of the
    output metrics contained here are also contained in the HTML report (though
    not all). But, importantly, this CSV file is easy to parse programmatically,
    so that a pipeline can make automatic decisions.  All metrics are scalar
    quantities, and the intent was to name them so they are self-explanatory.
    The contents are:

    1. ``total_raw_counts``: Sum of all input count matrix entries
    2. ``total_output_counts``: Sum of all output count matrix entries
    3. ``total_counts_removed``: 1 minus 2
    4. ``fraction_counts_removed``: 3 divided by 1
    5. ``total_raw_counts_in_cells``: Same as 1, but calculated only in CellBender-
       determined non-empty droplets
    6. ``total_counts_removed_from_cells``: 5 minus 2 (since only cells have
       nonzero counts in the output)
    7. ``fraction_counts_removed_from_cells``: 6 divided by 5
    8. ``average_counts_removed_per_cell``: 6 divided by the number of CellBender-
       determined non-empty droplets
    9. ``target_fpr``: The input ``--fpr`` value
    10. ``expected_cells``: The input ``--expected-cells`` value, blank if not
        provided.
    11. ``found_cells``: The number of CellBender-
        determined non-empty droplets
    12. ``output_average_counts_per_cell``: 2 divided by 11
    13. ``ratio_of_found_cells_to_expected_cells``: 11 divided by 10
    14. ``found_empties``: The number of empty droplets, as determined by
        CellBender. This number plus 11 equals the input
        ``--total-droplets-included`` (or the value used by default)
    15. ``fraction_of_analyzed_droplets_that_are_nonempty``: 11 divided by the
        input ``--total-droplets-included``
    16. ``convergence_indicator``: The mean absolute difference between successive
        values of the train ELBO for the last 3 epochs, divided by the standard
        deviation of the train ELBO over the last 20 epochs. A smaller number
        indicates better convergence. It's typical to see values of 0.25 or 0.35.
        Large values might indicate a failure to converge. (Not many people have
        yet used this in practice, so we might learn more about recommendations
        in future.)
    17. ``overall_change_in_train_elbo``: The change in ELBO from first to last
        epoch.

  * The most useful values for automated decision-making are probably 13, 15,
    and 16.

.. _a15:

* My HTML report summary (at the bottom) said there were some warnings.  What
  should I do about that?

  * If the warning comes with a recommendation to re-run with different settings,
    then that is worth a try.
  * Some warnings do not need further action, and simply reflect peculiarities
    of the specific dataset.

.. _a16:

* The tool failed to produce an HTML report

  * Please report the error as a github issue. The report-making process, since
    it makes use of Jupyter notebooks, is a bit of a fragile process. These
    reports are new in v0.3.0, and there has been less testing.

.. _a17:

* I ran the WDL in Terra and the job ``Failed`` with PAPI error code 9

  * Typically this is a so-called "transient" error, meaning that it was a random
    occurrance, and the job may succeed if run again without any changes.
    However, it is worth checking the log and checking "Job Manager" to see if
    there was a more specific error message.

.. _a18:

* How much does it cost, per sample, to run the WDL in Terra?

  * It depends on the size of the dataset, but $0.30 is pretty typical, as of
    the pricing used by Google Cloud in July 2022.

.. _a19:

* I am getting a GPU-out-of-memory error (process ``Killed``)

  * Please report the issue on github, but there are a few things you can try
    to reduce memory usage. Typically memory usage is highest during posterior
    sampling. Try setting ``--posterior-batch-size`` to 64, instead of its
    default value of 128. (Make sure to restart from the checkpoint file to
    avoid re-running inference.  This will happen automatically if you re-run
    in the same folder as the ``ckpt.tar.gz`` file.)
  * If you can, try running on an Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU, which has more RAM than
    some other options.
  * Currently, CellBender only makes use of 1 GPU, so extra GPUs will not help.

.. _a20:

* I got a ``nan`` error and the tool crashed

  * This is real bad. Definitely report this issue on github. You may be asked
    to re-run the tool using the ``--debug`` flag, to get more error messages
    for reporting.

.. _a21:

* There was an error!

  * Please report the issue on github. You may be asked
    to re-run the tool using the ``--debug`` flag, to get more error messages
    for reporting.

  * The following warning is emitted in the log file: "Warning: few empty droplets identified.
    Low UMI cutoff may be too high. Check the UMI decay curve, and decrease the
    ``--low-count-threshold`` parameter if necessary."

    * This warning indicates that no "surely empty" droplets were identified in the analysis.
      This means that the "empty droplet plateau" could not be identified.  The most likely
      explanation is that the level of background RNA is extremely low, and that the value
      of ``--low-count-threshold`` exceeds this level.  This would result in the empty
      droplet plateau being excluded from the analysis, which is not advisable.  This can be
      corrected by decreasing ``--low-count-threshold`` from its default of 15 to a value like 5.
